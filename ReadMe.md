Blackjack is a popular card game often played in casinos, and it's also known as "21" due to the objective of the game. The game is played with one or more decks of standard playing cards, and the goal is to beat the dealer by having a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Here's a basic concept of how a Blackjack game is played:

### **Objective:**

The objective of the game is to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand value without going over 21.

### **Card Values:**

* Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
* Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each.
* Aces can be worth either 1 point or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the player's hand more. For example, if you have an Ace and a 7, you can choose to count the Ace as 11, making your hand value 18.![1695352909003](https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/c%3A/Users/maissa/Desktop/projects/Javascript/black%20jack%20Game/image/ReadMe/1695352909003.png)
